Good Morning everyone,
It's a picture I got from a comedy.It's a really funny movie.
I have tried to find an interesting picture about news for this talk, but I failed. So it's the reason why I talk about this picture.
From the picture we can see there is a man in the tree and taking a photo of himself. Seems quiet happy. But do you know why he in the tree? Why his eyes looks a bit red ? And is he really happy?

His best friend divorced, so he bring his friend go on a trip to encounter a woman and start a new relationship. Unfortunately, in the middle of the trip, their car broke down at the same time they met a beautiful woman. At first, the beauty thought that these two people were not good people, so she sprayed them with an anti-wolf spray, so his eyes looked a little bit red. After the misunderstanding is eliminated, they went on trip together, the beauty used her car to drag their car forward, apprentally there should be a rope between two cars. His friend and the beautiful woman sat in front together, and he sat behind himself. As a result, people in the front talked about life and ideals. The most interesting thing happened, the rope between the two cars was broken, but the two of them talked very hot and did not notice that. Because the signal was particularly weak in the mountains, he climbed to the tree and called his friend. Imagine if you would be happy with such a thing? Of course, he was very angry, but after he called his friend, he turned to smile and take a selfie. 
This is the story of this picture.I want to end my talk with a sentence from the movie . In case of trouble, face to it.
Thank you for you attention.
