1. HSPA: high speed packet access; FWA: fixed wireless access; WMAN: wireless  area network; WPAN: wireless personal area network; QoS: voice & video; LOS: line of sight; ISI: inter symbol interference; ECC (Error Correction Code) ; FER, Frame Error Rate; BER, Bit Error Rate; RTS:Request to Send; CTS: Clear to Send; DFS: Distributed Coordination Function
2. replica; multipath

#### Important issues

1. LOS and NLOS; Inter Symbol Interference; Doppler Shift; Attenuation and Path Loss; Capture Effect ;
2. 

#### Understand the specificity of wireless links

1. Mobility or nomadism of users 
2. Speed, cost and efficiency of deployment 
3. Absence of cabling
4. Robustness: links reliability and auto- reconfiguration 
5. Emergent needs: 
	* Localization: home automation 
	* Industrial applications 
	* Comfort and multimedia 
	* Security and surveillance 

#### To ensure

1. High data rate
2. Low latency
3. Low jitter
4. Respect a certain QoS (voice and video)
5. Non harmful transmission power





1. Understand the basic physical phenomena in wireless communications 
2. Analyze wireless MAC protocols ïƒ˜Study examples of MAC layers of IEEE standards
3. Study routing in ZigBee networks 



1. A counter measure to avoid ISI is ECC (Error Correction Code) which consists in multiplying the number of bits that represents one bit (Hamming code)
2. All signals loose power over distance, this is called Path
	Loss
3. Doppler Shift
	* Change in the frequency that arises due to relative motion between the transmitter and the receiver 
	* If the receiver is moving towards the transmitter: the frequency gets higher 
	* If the receiver is moving away from the transmitter: the frequency gets lower 
	* If the receiver is moving in a perpendicular way in regards to the receiving signal: the frequency does not change
